# Project Overview

The main purpose of this project was to learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application.Its goal is to practice on creating test suits that automatically test our code functionality even if we add new stuff, this makes sure we don't break things.


## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.


## How to run

You may run this app by cloning or downloading this git repository to your local machine. Once you have the app on your machine, you will locate the repository folder and find the index.html. Open the index.html in your favorite browser and it will load.
